# U.S.-Traveling-Salesman
Based off the infamous traveling salesman problem. This website allows a user to enter up to 10 U.S. cities (duplicates allowed) and it calculates the shortest path that visits all such cities and shows the distance and order of travel.

Although the salesman problem has yet to be throughly solved, there are many ways to approximate near solutions. 
Here we "solve" the salesman problem through the orkish application of brute force, first creating a list
of all possible paths (or permutations) and selecting the first path with the minimal overall distance.
